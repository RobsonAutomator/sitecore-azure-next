# sitecore-azure-next

My proposal of Sitecore Azure Toolkit improvements 

## Auto login to Azure account

When you experiment with Sitecore deployment you need to login to your Azure account.
This simple task can be annoying then I will automate it details are described in my post: http://lets-share.senktas.net/2017/06/sitecore-on-azure-login.html

## Azure region compatibility with Sitecore

When you would like to deploy Sitecore on Azure you have to check if desired region fully supports Sitecore deployment.
You can do this manually using this [table](https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/617478) - or automate it. Details you can find here  http://lets-share.senktas.net/2017/07/sitecore-on-azure-test-sitecoreazuredeployment.html
